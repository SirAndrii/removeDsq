# A way to remove disqus ads
After one of my website become unproffitable I decided to end disqus paid subscripton. I saw huge blocks of irrelevant ads that **advertise some unelthical things**. This code is temporarly solution before migrating from disqus platform to another one.

At July 2021 disqus ad blocks have no 'src' source and have signature dsq in their names. Ð¡ode is scanning document for these patterns every 400 miliseconds. Put it inline everywhere you want.
